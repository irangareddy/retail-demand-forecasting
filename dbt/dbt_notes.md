In dbt, `+materialized: view` is a configuration parameter that determines how your SQL model will be created in the data warehouse. Let me explain the different materialization options:

1. `view` (what's shown in the image):
```yaml
+materialized: view
```
- Creates a SQL VIEW in your data warehouse
- The query is re-run every time you query the view
- No data is stored physically
- Good for:
  - Frequently changing source data
  - When you need real-time data
  - Saving storage space
  - Simple transformations

Other common materialization options include:

2. `table`:
```yaml
+materialized: table
```
- Creates a physical TABLE in your warehouse
- Data is stored on disk
- Query runs only when dbt model is executed
- Good for:
  - Complex queries that are slow to recompute
  - Data that doesn't change often
  - When query performance is important

3. `incremental`:
```yaml
+materialized: incremental
```
- Only processes new/changed data since last run
- Updates existing table instead of rebuilding
- Good for:
  - Large datasets
  - Frequent small updates
  - Reducing computation time

4. `ephemeral`:
```yaml
+materialized: ephemeral
```
- Doesn't create a table or view
- Code is injected as a CTE into dependent models
- Good for:
  - Intermediate transformations
  - Code that's only used by other models

The choice of materialization depends on your specific needs regarding:
- Query performance
- Storage space
- Data freshness
- Update frequency
- Computational resources

In the image, using `view` suggests this is likely a lighter-weight transformation that benefits from always having the latest source data when queried.
